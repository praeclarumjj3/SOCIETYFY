## Description

Societyfy is aimed at enabling people to find and meet people around them
with the same interest or rather craving at that very moment through
different chat rooms for each category.

There are 5 categories to choose from:

- Study
- Play
- Food
- Hangout
- Other

You can enter any category’s chatroom at any time depending on your
mood at that very instant of time and discover people with the same
interest to carry out any activity. You can have discussions in the chatroom,
can make plans, form new bonds with people, etc.

There’s also a users’ list corresponding to each chatroom, each assisted
with a map that displays the location of different users active in the
chatroom at that very point of time. If a user is sharing his/her location you
can tap on his/her name in the list which shall take you to the
corresponding marker on the map. Tapping on the marker, you can
determine a route to that user from your own location!

So, Societyfy helps you bond with new people and you never have to pull
back from something if you don’t find a company, Societyfy finds the
company for you so that you can enjoy every day!
